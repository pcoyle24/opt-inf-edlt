  abstract = {This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports
	the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant
	monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is
	typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing
	on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds
	strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing
	countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These
	results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections
	for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions,
	and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression
	to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses
	consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation.
	Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited
	by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive
	evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap
	is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based
	stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our
	findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors
	in the link between fiscal policy and inflation. IMF Staff Papers

	We show the implications of these facts for global specialization
	and trade: products where timely delivery is important will be produced
	near the source of final demand, where wages will be higher as a
	result. In the model, timely delivery is important because it allows
	retailers to respond to final demand fluctuations without holding
	costly inventories, and timely delivery is possible only from nearby
	locations. Using a unique dataset that allows us to measure the retail
	demand for timely delivery, we show that the sources of U.S. apparel
	imports have shifted in the way predicted by the model, with products
	for which timeliness matters increasingly imported from nearby countries.},

  abstract = {Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we first document
	that the recent increase in income inequality in the U.S. has not
	been accompanied by a corresponding rise in consumption inequality.
	Much of this divergence is due to different trends in within-group
	inequality, which has increased significantly for income, but little
	for consumption. We then develop a simple framework that allows us
	to characterize analytically how within-group income inequality affects
	consumption inequality in a world in which agents can trade a full
	set of contingent consumption claims, subject to endogenous constraints
	emanating from the limited enforcement of intertemporal contracts.
	Finally, we quantitatively evaluate, in the context of a calibrated
	general equilibrium production economy, whether this set-up, or alternatively
	a standard incomplete markets model, can account for the documented
	stylized consumption inequality facts from the U.S. data.},
